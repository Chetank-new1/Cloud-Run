Cloud Run

These folder's are the files for static web app and this is a file provided to me by https://github.com/abhisheksharm-3.
He is my batchmate and i hosted his website on cloud run by first containerizing the web app in Docker file.
Then adding the Docker file to GCP's Artifact Registry and then Deploying the app through Cloud Run.

the public link for the same website is given below:

https://new-build-tokyotaste-i36zky5e5a-uc.a.run.app/

No Features or nothing done by me, just simple hosting of static website on Cloud Run using Docker and GCP.
